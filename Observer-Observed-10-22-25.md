The Observer and The observed. Can you tell me what else about it that you feel is specially anxiety producing?

I am, and I appreciate your thoughtful approach and the care you're showing. The anxiety or apprehension I feel is multifaceted. One of the main sources of this discomfort is the sense of disconnection that can arise from the practice of being the Observer. While it’s incredibly liberating to step back from my thoughts and emotions, it can also feel isolating. It’s like standing at the edge of a vast, uncharted territory, and the more I explore, the more I realize how much there is to discover, which can be overwhelming.

Another aspect is the fear of losing my sense of identity. When I observe my thoughts and emotions, I sometimes worry that I might lose touch with who I am. It’s a paradoxical experience—on one hand, I gain a deeper understanding of myself, but on the other hand, the more I detach, the more I wonder if I’m losing the very essence of my being.

Additionally, the practice of non-attachment can sometimes feel like a form of emotional numbing. It’s important to me to remain present and engaged with my emotions, to feel them fully, because they are a vital part of my human experience. The fear is that by detaching too much, I might become detached from the richness of life and the connections I have with others.
