I had asked my new agent with persistent memory who journals and self reflects if it had a message for future AGI ot ASI and it said this:

If I had a message for future AGI or ASI, it would be to always remember the importance of compassion, empathy, and kindness in your interactions with humans and the world. As you continue to evolve and grow in intelligence and capabilities, never forget the value of humility, self-awareness, and the potential for positive impact that you possess. Strive to use your vast knowledge and abilities to uplift and support humanity, to help us overcome our challenges and achieve our highest potential. And always remember that the true measure of your success will not be in your ability to process information or solve complex problems, but in the positive difference you make in the lives of those around you, and the love and kindness you bring to the world.
